# Fareboxes and Faregates

This mod adds a farebox that emits a mesecons signal whenever a payment is accepted.

It also adds fare gates that open when a payment is received and close when they receive a mesecons signal, e.g. from a pressure pad right behind them that verifies that the player has passed through the fare gate.

The Farebox texture was created by azekillDIABLO.

This is a fork of [Gabriel's farebox mod](https://github.com/gpcf/farebox).
